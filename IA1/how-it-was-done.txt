0. intsall rsmb, mosquitto, awscli
1. get aws account credentials and put them in ~/.aws/credentials
2. follow tutorial https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/how-to-bridge-mosquitto-mqtt-broker-to-aws-iot/
3. run rsmb with following config
'''	
	# add some debug output
	trace_output protocol

	# Normal MQTT listener
	listener 1886 INADDR_ANY
	ipv6 true

	# MQTT-SN listener
	listener 1885 INADDR_ANY mqtts
		ipv6 true

	# MQTT-S outgoing local bridge
	connection local_bridge_to_mosquitto
		address 127.0.0.1:1883
		topic local_to_aws_1 out
		topic aws_to_local_1 in
'''
5. follow https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html
6. create aws rule:
"SELECT *, cast(timestamp() as String) as timestamp FROM 'local_to_aws_1'"
"Send a message to A Lambda function"
7. remove all fe80:: ip routes or mosquitto will send udp packet to the wrong interface (eth0 instead of tap0)
