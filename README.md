# IoT-2021 - Individual Assignments Repository

This project has been carried out during the IoT Course at Sapienza University of Rome, and it consists of three different assignment. 

## Plant Monitor System

The goal of this project is to monitor a plants conditions, to see if necessary needs are met.

In every directory there is the code and documentation of each individual assignments. An the sources are structured in this way:
- `iot-device` contains the riot os application for the sensor nodes.
- `lambda_functions` contains the code of the aws lambda functions used.
- `dashboard` is the dasboard code used for the project.
- `how-it-was-done.txt` is the list the fundamentals steps needed to create from scratch the system.
